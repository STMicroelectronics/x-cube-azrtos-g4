<h2><b>Tx_LowPower application description</b></h2>
<p>This application provides an example of Azure RTOS ThreadX stack usage, it shows how to develop an application using ThreadX low power feature. The main entry function tx_application_define() is then called by ThreadX during kernel start, at this stage, the application creates 1 thread and 1 semaphore:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>MainThread (Prio : 10; Preemption Threshold : 10)</p></li>
<li><p>Semaphore (Initial count = 0 to prevent its acquisition by the MainThread, on the application start)</p></li>
<li><p>‘MainThread’:</p>
<ul>
<li>Main thread tries to acquire the ‘Semaphore’.</li>
<li>On Success toggles the ‘LED_GREEN’ each 500 ms for 5 secs.</li>
<li>On Failure it switches to supended mode waiting for the ‘Semaphore’ to be released.</li>
<li>The steps above are repeated indefinitely.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>When the “MainThread” is in suspended state, waiting for the ‘Semaphore’, the system is in idle state and the scheduler decides to enter in low mode by calling the TX_LOW_POWER_USER_ENTER that makes the system enter the stop mode via the HAL_PWR_EnterSTOPMode() API.</p>
<p>As soon as the User button is pressed, the ‘Semaphore’ is released, and the ‘MainThread’ passes in Active state.</p>
<p>The scheduler exits the stop mode by calling the TX_LOW_POWER_EXIT.</p>
<p>In System STOP mode, all I/O pins keep the same state as in Run mode.</p>
<p>When exiting the Stop mode, the MCU is in Run mode (Range 1 or Range 2 depending on VOS bit in PWR_CR1).</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><b>tx_low_power_enter()</b> service enters low power mode. For keeping track of time while in low power mode, there are two possibilities:</p>
<p>1.1. A ThreadX timer is active: Function <strong>tx_timer_get_next</strong> returns <strong>TX_TRUE</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that in this situation, a low power clock must be used in order to wake up the CPU for the next ThreadX timer expiration.</p>
<p>Therefore an alternative clock must be programmed. Program the hardware timer source such that the next timer interrupt is equal to: <em>tx_low_power_next_expiration</em> tick_frequency. The <em>tick_frequency</em> is application-specific and typically set up in <strong>tx_low_level_initialize</strong>.</p>
<p>1.2. There are no ThreadX timers active: Function <strong>tx_timer_get_next</strong> returns <strong>TX_FALSE</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>1.2.1. The application may choose not to keep the ThreadX internal
tick count updated (define **TX_LOW_POWER_TICKLESS**), therefore there is no need
to set up a low power clock.

1.2.2. The application still needs to keep the ThreadX tick up-to-date. In this case a low power clock needs to be set up.</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Entering Low-power mode through WFI will be executed only if no interrupt is pending.</p></li>
<li><p>The Debug Module must be stopped during STOP mode, otherwise, It will generate interrupts that cause the Wake-up of the system immediately after entering the Stop mode.</p></li>
<li><p>The user push-button interrupt priority must be set to the highest possible value, otherwise, after Exit Stop mode the processor will not execute the interrupt handler.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="threadx-usage-hints"><b>ThreadX usage hints</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>ThreadX uses the Systick as time base, thus it is mandatory that the HAL uses a separate time base through the TIM IPs.</li>
<li>ThreadX is configured with 100 ticks/sec by default, this should be taken into account when using delays or timeouts at application. It is always possible to reconfigure it in the “tx_user.h”, the “TX_TIMER_TICKS_PER_SECOND” define,but this should be reflected in “tx_initialize_low_level.s” file too.</li>
<li>ThreadX is disabling all interrupts during kernel start-up to avoid any unexpected behavior, therefore all system related calls (HAL, BSP) should be done either at the beginning of the application or inside the thread entry functions.</li>
<li>ThreadX offers the “tx_application_define()” function, that is automatically called by the tx_kernel_enter() API. It is highly recommended to use it to create all applications ThreadX related resources (threads, semaphores, memory pools…) but it should not in any way contain a system API call (HAL or BSP).</li>
<li>Using dynamic memory allocation requires to apply some changes to the linker file. ThreadX needs to pass a pointer to the first free memory location in RAM to the tx_application_define() function, using the “first_unused_memory” argument. This require changes in the linker files to expose this memory location.
<ul>
<li><p>For EWARM add the following section into the .icf file: <code>place in RAM_region    { last section FREE_MEM };</code></p></li>
<li><p>For MDK-ARM: <code>either define the RW_IRAM1 region in the ".sct" file  or modify the line below in "tx_low_level_initilize.s to match the memory region being used      LDR r1, =|Image$$RW_IRAM1$$ZI$$Limit|</code></p></li>
<li><p>For STM32CubeIDE add the following section into the .ld file: <code>._threadx_heap :    {       . = ALIGN(8);       __RAM_segment_used_end__ = .;       . = . + 64K;       . = ALIGN(8);     } &gt;RAM_D1 AT&gt; RAM_D1</code></p>
<p>The simplest way to provide memory for ThreadX is to define a new section, see ._threadx_heap above. In the example above the ThreadX heap size is set to 64KBytes. The ._threadx_heap must be located between the .bss and the ._user_heap_stack sections in the linker script. Caution: Make sure that ThreadX does not need more than the provided heap memory (64KBytes in this example). Read more in STM32CubeIDE User Guide, chapter: “Linker script”.</p></li>
<li><p>The “tx_initialize_low_level.s” should be also modified to enable the “USE_DYNAMIC_MEMORY_ALLOCATION” flag.</p></li>
