<h2><b>Fx_NoR_Write_Read_File application description</b></h2>
<p>This application provides an example of Azure RTOS FileX and LevelX stacks usage on STM32G474E-EVAL board, it demonstrates how to create</p>
<p>a Fat File system on the NOR flash using FileX alongside LevelX. The application is designed to execute file operations on the MT25QL512ABB</p>
<p>NOR flash device, the code provides all required software code for properly managing it.</p>
<p>The application starts by calling the ThreadX’s initialization routine which executes the main thread that handles file operations. At this stage,</p>
<p>all FileX resources are created, the MT25QL512ABB driver is initialized and a single thread is created:</p>
<ul>
<li>fx_thread (Prio : 10; PreemptionPrio : 10) used for file operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fx_thread will start by erasing the NOR flash then formatting it using FileX services. The resulting file system is a FAT32 compatible, with 512 bytes per sector</p>
<p>and 8 sectors per cluster.</p>
<p>The NOR Flash erase operation may take a while, do not interrupt it.</p>
<p>The following flags are enabled in the lx_stm32_qspi_driver.h:</p>
<ul>
<li>LX_STM32_QSPI_INIT</li>
<li>LX_STM32_QSPI_ERASE</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon successful opening of the flash media, FileX continue with creating a file called “STM32.TXT” into the root directory, then write into it</p>
<p>some dummy data. Then file is re-opened in read only mode and content is checked.</p>
<p>Through all the steps, FileX/LevelX services are called to print the flash size available before and after the example file is written into the flash.</p>
<p>The number of occupied sectors is also shown.</p>
<h4 id="expected-success-behavior"><b>Expected success behavior</b></h4>
<p>Successful operation is marked by a toggeling green LED light.</p>
<p>Also, information regarding the total and available size of the flash media is printed to the serial port.</p>
<h4 id="error-behaviors"><b>Error behaviors</b></h4>
<p>On failure, the red LED starts toggeling while the green LED is switched OFF.</p>
<h4 id="assumptions-if-any"><b>Assumptions if any</b></h4>
<p>None</p>
<h4 id="known-limitations"><b>Known limitations</b></h4>
<p>When using the STM32CubeProgrammer to erase the NOR flash, make sure to power-off, power-on the board before running the application.</p>
<h4 id="threadx-usage-hints"><b>ThreadX usage hints</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>ThreadX uses the Systick as time base, thus it is mandatory that the HAL uses a separate time base through the TIM IPs.</li>
<li>ThreadX is configured with 100 ticks/sec by default, this should be taken into account when using delays or timeouts at application. It is always possible to reconfigure it in the “tx_user.h”, the “TX_TIMER_TICKS_PER_SECOND” define,but this should be reflected in “tx_initialize_low_level.s” file too.</li>
<li>ThreadX is disabling all interrupts during kernel start-up to avoid any unexpected behavior, therefore all system related calls (HAL, BSP) should be done either at the beginning of the application or inside the thread entry functions.</li>
<li>ThreadX offers the “tx_application_define()” function, that is automatically called by the tx_kernel_enter() API. It is highly recommended to use it to create all applications ThreadX related resources (threads, semaphores, memory pools…) but it should not in any way contain a system API call (HAL or BSP).</li>
<li>Using dynamic memory allocation requires to apply some changes to the linker file. ThreadX needs to pass a pointer to the first free memory location in RAM to the tx_application_define() function, using the “first_unused_memory” argument. This require changes in the linker files to expose this memory location.
<ul>
<li>For EWARM add the following section into the .icf file:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>  place in RAM_region    { last section FREE_MEM };</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>For MDK-ARM:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>either define the RW_IRAM1 region in the &quot;.sct&quot; file
or modify the line below in &quot;tx_low_level_initilize.s to match the memory region being used
    LDR r1, =|Image$$RW_IRAM1$$ZI$$Limit|</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>For STM32CubeIDE add the following section into the .ld file:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>._threadx_heap :
  {
     . = ALIGN(8);
     __RAM_segment_used_end__ = .;
     . = . + 64K;
     . = ALIGN(8);
   } &gt;RAM_D1 AT&gt; RAM_D1</code></pre>
<pre><code>The simplest way to provide memory for ThreadX is to define a new section, see ._threadx_heap above.
In the example above the ThreadX heap size is set to 64KBytes.
The ._threadx_heap must be located between the .bss and the ._user_heap_stack sections in the linker script.
Caution: Make sure that ThreadX does not need more than the provided heap memory (64KBytes in this example).
Read more in STM32CubeIDE User Guide, chapter: &quot;Linker script&quot;.</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The “tx_initialize_low_level.s” should be also modified to enable the “USE_DYNAMIC_MEMORY_ALLOCATION” flag.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="filexlevelx-usage-hints"><b>FileX/LevelX usage hints</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>When calling the fx_media_format() API, it is highly recommended to understand all the parameters used by the API to correctly generate a valid filesystem.</li>
<li>FileX is using data buffers, passed as arguments to fx_media_open(), fx_media_read() and fx_media_write() API it is recommended that these buffers are multiple of sector size and “4 bytes” aligned to avoid unaligned access issues.</li>
